Unfortunately, we were unable to arrange transportation for Munich-based participants [like for our Swedish friends]({{< ref "airport-shuttle" >}}). We kindly ask that you organize your own travel, such as carpooling. Feel free to use our Slack channel to coordinate with others for shared rides.

If you arrive by train, we are sorry for the inconvenience but are happy to offer a pickup service at [Parsberg Bahnhof](https://www.bahnhof.de/parsberg). Please let us know if you'd like to use this service.
