### Morning

In the morning, we discuss our visions for software engineering (research). Please see the required [preparations](#preparations).

### Afternoon

In the afternoon, we have plenty of time to discuss, network, and build working groups.

## Preparations

In advance of our research retreat, please prepare two short talks.

### Talk 1: Overview of your research

In this talk for day 1, you will have **five minutes** (plus discussions) for presenting an overview of your research.

Focus on your research area (general), studies/work you are currently working on, potential for collaborations, current obstacles, etc. Those of you currently pursuing a PhD can, for example, include their PhD roadmap, if available. Those of you working on postdoctoral studies may have a broader perspective. The goal is really to allow the entire group to get a good idea of what your current work focuses on and what your expertise is.

### Talk 2: Blue Sky Vision (Time: 10 minutes max + discussions)

In the second talk, go wild and speculate in your **ten minutes talk**  (plus discussions) on your view what is the next big thing in software engineering (research).

Again, in a short talk, please elaborate on your idealistic view on research that you would like to do in the future (up to 10 years from now). You must convey the picture of a topic area that you personally think is highly important to work on – regardless of any potential constraints like funding and regardless of topics you might be currently focusing on (e.g., PhD-related or project-related). Again, this shall foster discussions in the group on our joint future vision and lay the foundation for joint work across fortiss, BTH, and related institutions heading in that direction(s) and what is necessary to reach that ambitious goal.
